# NodeJs_RESTApi

A simple REST Api sample created on node.js

You should have mongo installed in local to ake it works.
Don't forget to do a :
$npm install

I use gult to manage all tasks, so don't forget to do (if it's not already done)
$npm install gulp -g

you could start the server on the port 5000, by doing :
$gulp
Don't try to start with node app.js or npm start, because the env variables are defined (fr now) only on gulp.
